# open128


![Render of PCB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgrip/open128/main/Pictures/open128-render.jpg)

This is a clone of the Commodore 128 home computer made with KiCad, licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

It contains both schematic and PCB layout, based on the Neo128 project by me.
This PCB has not yet been manufactured and tested however there are minimal changes compared to the well tested Neo128.

Some of the components have been copied from the [bit-preserve project](https://github.com/baldengineer/bit-preserve) and modified.

For Bill of Material and other documentation, please see https://c128.se
